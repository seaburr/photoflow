# Photoflow

A tool to make importing photo assets easier.

## Goals
I find the import of photos from the SD card to Lightroom to be a cumbersome process. My hope to to simplify the process from media to import, making this as quick and painless as possible. 

## Other Goals
I'm considering tackling some of the duldrum initial editing I do (applying 'starter' profiles to images) so I can get to work editing in earnest that much faster.

## Development Status
**State:** *Pipedream*

This should not be used by anyone for anything. It's currently a dumping ground for scripts and ideas as a tool coalesces.
